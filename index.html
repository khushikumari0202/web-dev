        <b>About</b>
        <br/>
        <strong><big> Women's health </big></strong> encompasses a range of physical, mental, and social well-being considerations specific to women. 
        Key aspects include reproductive health, which involves issues like menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. 
        Additionally, women's health addresses conditions such as breast health, gynecological health, and hormonal balance.
        Regular check-ups, screenings, and preventive measures, such as vaccinations, are crucial for maintaining overall health. 
        Mental health is also a vital component, with factors like stress, depression, and anxiety affecting women differently than men.
        Promoting a healthy lifestyle through proper nutrition, exercise, and managing stress is fundamental for women's well-being. 
        Issues such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular health are important areas of focus in women's 
        health. Access to healthcare, education, and awareness are essential for empowering women to make informed decisions 
        about their health and to address health disparities. Overall, a holistic approach to women's health considers both biological 
        and socio-economic factors.
